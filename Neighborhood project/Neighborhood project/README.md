It has a google map including highlighted locations, third-party data about the locations and various ways to browse the content.

### Project - Solution 

1. GoogleMap Api - I used GoogleMap Javascript Api to build the map, markers, marker animations, and infowindows.  
( https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/?hl=en )

2. Wikipedia Api with Ajax - I used jQuery Ajax to call Wikipedia Api. 
( http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/ )

3. I used javascript DOM event to make a sidebar and togglemenu. 

4. I tried to find solutions and what to do on the internet. 
( Cat clicker example and Google map example from the course, 
  Google web search, Stackoverflow, Knockout.js documentation, Udacity discussion forum etc. )
